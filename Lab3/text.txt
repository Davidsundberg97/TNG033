I was wondering if it is possible to get back the code that I wrote on the last tenta to be able to compare it to the solutions now out on the course website.
It would be very useful for me to see what things were okay and what parts I had gotten some of the way, 
just so I know exactly what I should focus on. 
I know that you do not prioritize email from students whose courses you don't have at the moment but I hope for a quick response.
